\section{Introduction}

\begin{quote}
``Anyone who has tried to determine what operation is accomplished by someone else's machine language
program knows that $E$ itself (i.e., what $E$ does) can be hard to infer from an algorithm for $E$.'
 --- Diffie and Hellman, 1976 \cite{newDirections}
\end{quote}

%Intuitively, software practitioners know that obfuscating an algorithm

\section{Applications}

From \cite{onThe(Im)possibility}:

Protection from reverse engineering.

Watermarking software (cites ``cf., [CT, NSS]'') -
software vendor adds some behavior to uniquely identify the
customer, and makes it hard to remove.

Convert any public key system into a homomorphic system
(write an algorithm that uses the private key, then obfuscate it).

Random oracles (I don't understand this one).

Convert any symmetric encryption into asymmetric encryption.
\cite{newDirections} suggested using obfuscation for public key cryptography.

\section{Virtual black box}

The ``virtual black box'' property gives a strong definition of the hiding behavior we would desire in an obfuscator.
An adversary with an obfuscated program can, of course, execute it, which provides the same power as oracle access.
We would like this to be the full extent of the adversary's power; it should not be able to discern any additional
information by inspecting the obfuscated code.

It is not immediately obvious how to formalize the notion of \textit{any additional information} ---
What properties of the original program need to be hidden?
\cite{onThe(Im)possibility} proves that regardless of how this question is answered,
a general obfuscator is unattainable.



The most lenient answer we can give, resulting in the weakest definition of obfuscation, is to merely
require the obfuscator to hide the value of \textit{any} predicate of the original program.
